# Discord.py Bot

A dusty discord.py bot script I found on my hard drive. I'm not using it so if it can help somebody I might as well share it.

> [!CAUTION]
> I would recommend making sure the code isn't deprecated as it might not work out of the box.

## ðŸ“– Installation

* Paste the source code on any selfhosted Discord bot website supporting Python

	OR

* Run the script locally with any software that handles Python runtime
